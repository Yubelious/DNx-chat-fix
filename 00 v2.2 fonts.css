@description   Jaden and Yubel v2.0 (featuring Chatbox and other scrolling fixes)
Inspired by O OO/The XAZ.
Special thanks to Skeletonxf for finally coming up with a chatbox and getting me back into this. This style wouldn't have a licence without you.
Open for testing and feedback. Potentially compatible with any resolution on almost any device.
