# Jaden-and-Yubel

**Description:**
So this is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the upcoming online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). They currently have public alpha testing open at: https://duelingnexus.com

**Notes from latest update:**
1.0 I made everything bigger, with a goal of seeing it across the room. I also added some images that match a theme. While waiting for a duel, click-and-hold the "Ready" button and pull down. The button will spin like and hourglass.
1.1 Made text even larger, fixed a border collapse (kinda), pulled in #tab-duel p to top left corner, added a new background image, moved some things around, "Ready" button no longer flips upside down when hovered over, increased the size of the duel menu, and changed the colour of the bar on the top.
