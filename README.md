# Jaden-and-Yubel

**Description:**
So this is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the upcoming online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). They currently have public alpha testing open at: https://duelingnexus.com

**Notes from latest update:**
1.3 Tested in multiple resolutions, tested using multiple browsers, darkened and resized table, added an indent + word-break to the username under the Avatar in-duel, cleaned up the deck constructor on 720p, moved the chat box away from the bottom of the screen, messed around with transparency, fixed the siding screen, moved the loading container down, added an animation to the options pop-up, and added a delay to the spinning buttons.*/
