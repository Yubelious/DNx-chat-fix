# J×Y

**Description:**
J×Y (Jaden and Yubel v2 featuring chat box and other scrolling fixes) is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). This theme applies to here:

I'd like to give special thanks to Skeleton for helping me get back into this. If you don't want a background or themed colours, check out his fixes at https://userstyles.org/styles/144946/duelingnexus-chat-monster-info-split-view. J×Y is mainly a theme for a game we like to play, but also includes some much-needed fixes. Expect to see new background images, larger more visible text, scrollbars where there were once no scrollbars, and the use of most of your display. It should now work on most displays, including mobile.

**Notes from latest update:**
2.2 Positioned and sized each button on the navbar to fix mobile issues, resized the login/register tabs, moved some things around to make them appear better on mobile, fixed the buttons in the deck editor, added solid fallback colours to gradients/transparency.
