# J×Y

**Description:**
J×Y (Jaden and Yubel v2.0 featuring chat box and other scrolling fixes)

So this is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the upcoming online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). They currently have public alpha testing open at:

I'd like to give special thanks to Skeleton for helping me get back into this. If you don't want a background or themed colours, check out his fixes at https://userstyles.org/styles/144946/duelingnexus-chat-monster-info-split-view. J×Y is mainly a theme for a game we like to play, but also includes some much-needed fixes. Expect to see new background images, larger more visible text, scrollbars where there were once no scrollbars, and the use of most of your display. It should now work on most displays, including mobile.

**Notes from latest update:**
2.0 Added a solid colour to the background for before the huge background image loads, completely rewrote the navbar from the ground up, found a way to set apart the Chat button from the disabled buttons since it still works while logged out, designated "a" more specifically, designated buttons more specifically, designated tables more specifically, styled a link on the register page, fixed the checkbox label, fixed a bug that affected an animation on the login button, moved the login/register container down to allow room for the alert on smaller resolutions, adjusted said alert, specified padding around the new .profile-if-not-contributer (ads and progress bar), removed the margin from .profile-if-not-contributer, styled the new buttons found on the news tab, added padding to #newsMain so the computer's taskbar doesn't block the interface, styled the progress bar, made .mlabel a lot more noticable (you can't miss it!), adjusted the padding on the duel home buttons, hid the duel tab's overflow to prevent a scrollbar from appearing, changed the quote on the Decks tab from Jaden's "Get your game on!" to Yubel's "Now prepare to feel my wrath!" as this is where you prepare for a duel, replaced the duel table background with a higher quality version, replaced the decks table background with a new image, moved the buttons on the deck tab, added a new background to the container in login/register, resized the login/register container to fit the new background, adjusted the a links in the login/register container, added the words "Dueling Nexus" to duels, added a bouncing ball animation while waiting for a duel to connect, added a Yu-Gi-Oh! logo behind "Dueling Nexus", rewrote the entire siding screen, rewrote much of the deck pages into siding to reduce lines of code, imported some Google Fonts into the style, added effects to the avatar, set min-height/min-width for engine buttons so empty buttons are easier to click, added content to all of the engine buttons in the game option list so the bottoms line up, made minor changes to the duel field gradients, coded the name announce window, resized the rps pictures so they fit better on all resolutions, changed the colour of selectable field zones.
