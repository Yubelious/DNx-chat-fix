# Jaden-and-Yubel

**Description:**
So this is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the upcoming online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). They currently have public alpha testing open at: https://duelingnexus.com

**Notes from latest update:**
1.2 Tested in multiple resolutions, changed some units of measurements to reflect those resolutions, collapsed the border of the search result table, added a few scroll bars, added more transparent gradient backgrounds, made the search description move when hovered over, hid .loadmore, more green h4, got rid of some things made obsolete by an update, fixed the buttons on the login screen, tried a new "not-allowed" button setup, modified most of the text shadows, changed some colours around in the .engine-buttons, added more scrollbars, and contained chat inside a box.*/
