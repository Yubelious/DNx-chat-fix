# J×Y

**Description:**
J×Y (Jaden and Yubel v2.1 featuring chat box and other scrolling fixes) is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the upcoming online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). They currently have public alpha testing open at:

I'd like to give special thanks to Skeleton for helping me get back into this. If you don't want a background or themed colours, check out his fixes at https://userstyles.org/styles/144946/duelingnexus-chat-monster-info-split-view. J×Y is mainly a theme for a game we like to play, but also includes some much-needed fixes. Expect to see new background images, larger more visible text, scrollbars where there were once no scrollbars, and the use of most of your display. It should now work on most displays, including mobile.

**Notes from latest update:**
2.1 Coded the settings tab that showed up a couple months ago, added settings tab related things to the global code, set min-width of buttons to 0 for smaller resolutions, adjusted the padding on .h3, adjusted the margin on .h2, resized .h2 and .h4, added a new logo to the duel and editor pages, moved the #downloadDeck.engine-button away from the standard buttons, fixed a bug with padding that caused the .engine-buttons to push beyond the bottom of the #editor-menu-container on lower resolutions, adjusted said .engine-buttons to be more similar on all resolutions, reduced the font size in #card-description-box to prevent an unsightly horizontal scrollbar, set the font weight of #card-if-monster to bold to match the bold in the card image, coded in a box in siding, filled the box with a description on how to side, z-indexed the button#game-siding-done.
