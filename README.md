# J×Y

**Description:**
J×Y (Jaden and Yubel v3 skin to the CSS Fixes Project for Dueling Nexus) is a Yu-Gi-Oh! GX themed style affecting the online Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator Dueling Nexus (or DNx for short). This theme applies to here:

https://duelingnexus.com/

J×Y should not be run by itself. It is a skin that can be run over (and is a part of) the CSS Fixes Project for Dueling Nexus. The base of the project can be found here: https://userstyles.org/styles/169750/css-fixes-project-for-dueling-nexus.
Expect to see new background images and larger more colorful text, as well as some interesting features you won't find on other themes. If you need help, these skins come with complementary customer support, so feel free to DM me on Discord @Yubelious#5584, or find me on the official Dueling Nexus Discord Server.

**Notes from latest update:**
3.0 Version 2 didn't last as long as I expected. Dueling Nexus released a patch that killed half my theme. So I moved all of my CSS fixes to a new project, and started this from scratch after I stablized that one. Wrote new CSS to affect the new nav pages with mostly the same colour scheme and images (some of the positioning can no longer be duplicated), resized button images, and added a new log-in animation. A lot of things were lost during the move.
