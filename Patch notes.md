/*With the release of MR4, and the changes to Firefox in mind, I'm releasing my biggest patch yet! For V2.0, I started from scratch using previous versions as a reference for colors and whatnot. Without further ado, here's some patch notes.*/
/*Changelog
2.0 Added a solid color to the background for before the huge background image loads, completely rewrote the navbar from the ground up, found a way to set apart the Chat button from the disabled buttons since it still works while logged out, designated "a" more specifically, designated buttons more specifically, designated tables more specifically, styled a link on the register page, fixed the checkbox label, fixed a bug that affected an animation on the login button, moved the login/register container down to allow room for the alert on smaller resolutions, adjusted said alert, specified padding around the new .profile-if-not-contributer (ads and progress bar), removed the margin from .profile-if-not-contributer, styled the new buttons found on the news tab, added padding to #newsMain so the computer's taskbar doesn't block the interface, styled the progress bar, made .mlabel a lot more noticable (you can't miss it!), adjusted the padding on the duel home buttons, hid the duel tab's overflow to prevent a scrollbar from appearing, changed the quote on the Decks tab from Jaden's "Get your game on!" to Yubel's "Now prepare to feel my wrath!" as this is where you prepare for a duel, replaced the duel table background with a higher quality version, replaced the decks table background with a new image, moved the buttons on the deck tab, added a new background to the container in login/register, resized the login/register container to fit the new background, adjusted the a links in the login/register container, added the words "Dueling Nexus" to duels, added a bouncing ball animation while waiting for a duel to connect, added a Yu-Gi-Oh! logo behind "Dueling Nexus", rewrote the entire siding screen, rewrote much of the deck pages into siding to reduce lines of code, imported some Google Fonts into the style, added effects to the avatar, set min-height/min-width for engine buttons so empty buttons are easier to click, made minor changes to the duel field gradients, coded the name announce window.

1.4 Adjusted buttons to match the new VRAINS-era Dueling Nexus, added a scrollbar to the announce window.
1.3 Tested in multiple resolutions, tested using multiple browsers, darkened and resized table, added an indent + word-break to the username under the Avatar in-duel, cleaned up the deck constructor on 720p, moved the chat box away from the bottom of the screen, messed around with transparency, fixed the siding screen, moved the loading container down, added an animation to the options pop-up, and added a delay to the spinning buttons.
1.2 Tested in multiple resolutions, changed some units of measurements to reflect those resolutions, collapsed the border of the search result table, added a few scroll bars, added more transparent gradient backgrounds, made the search description move when hovered over, hid .loadmore, more green h4, got rid of some things made obsolete by an update, fixed the buttons on the login screen, tried a new "not-allowed" button setup, modified most of the text shadows, changed some colours around in the .engine-buttons, added more scrollbars, and contained chat inside a box.
1.1 Made text even larger, fixed a border collapse (kinda), pulled in #tab-duel p to top left corner, added a new background image, moved some things around, "Ready" button no longer flips upside down when hovered over, increased the size of the duel menu, and changed the colour of the bar on the top.
1.0 I made everything bigger, with a goal of seeing it across the room. I also added some images that match a theme. While waiting for a duel, click-and-hold the "Ready" button and pull down. The button will spin like and hourglass.
