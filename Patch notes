/*With the release of MR4, I'll be doing my biggest patch yet! For V2.0, I started from scratch using v1.4 as a reference for colors and whatnot. Completely rewrote the navbar from the ground up, found a way to set apart the Chat button from the disabled buttons since it still works while logged out, designated "a" more specifically, designated buttons more specifically, styled a link on the register page, fixed the checkbox label, fixed a bug that affected an animation on the login button, moved the login/register container down to allow room for the alert on smaller resolutions, adjusted said alert, specified padding around the new .profile-if-not-contributer (ads and progress bar), removed the margin from .profile-if-not-contributer, styled the new buttons found on the news tab, added padding to #newsMain so the computer's taskbar doesn't block the interface, styled the progress bar, made .mlabel a lot more noticable (you can't miss it!), adjusted the padding on the duel home buttons, and hid the duel tab's overflow to prevent a scrollbar from appearing.*/
