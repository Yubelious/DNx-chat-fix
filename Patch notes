/*With the release of MR4, I'll be doing my biggest patch yet! For V2.0, I started from scratch using v1.4 as a reference for colors and whatnot. Completely rewrote the navbar from the ground up, found a way to set apart the Chat button from the disabled buttons since it still works while logged out, designated "a" more specifically, styled a link on the register page, and fixed a bug that affected an animation on the login button.
